# Variant shared proportion of sample pairs

The script is used for calculating the shared variant proportion at the whole genome-level of influenza virus between any possible pairs of samples collected from same individual pigs (individual pairs), from any two pigs co-housed in the same room (household pairs/room pairs), and from any different pigs (random pairs).

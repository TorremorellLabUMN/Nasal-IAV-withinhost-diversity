# Transmission pairs permutation test

To determine whether the putative transmission sample pairs shared more variant proportions than random chance, we wrote this script which randomly picking up and calculating the variant shared proportions of 100,000 pairs of samples (random sample pairs) collected from any two individual pigs, and generated the null distribution to compare with the shared variant proportion from each putative transmission sample pair.

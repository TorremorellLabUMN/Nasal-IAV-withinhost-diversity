# Shared sites permutation test

The shared sites permutation test is performed for each treatment group to identify whether the pigs from different rooms of any groups shared more number of influenza polymorphic amino acid sites than random chance. The python script will simulate the process by randomly having same number of polymorphic amino acid sites for each influenza coding region and sample as the actual data for 100,000 times. 
During each iteration, we count the total number of polymorphic amino acid sites that shared in at least two pigs from different room (the number of polymorphic sites shared between samples from same pig and the number of polymorphic sites shared between pigs from the same room are excluded). The null distribution is generated by 100,000 counted shared polymorphic sites from every iteration and compare with the actural number of shared polymorphic sites shared in at least two pigs from different rooms to get the p-value.

The python script is adapted from https://github.com/blab/h5n1-cambodia/blob/master/figures/figure-5b-shared-sites-permutation-test.ipynb.

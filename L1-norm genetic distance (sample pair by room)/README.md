# IAV L1-norm genetic distance between sample pairs

The script is used for calculating the genetic distance at the whole genome-level of influenza virus in L1-norm between any possible pairs of samples collected from same individual pigs (individual pairs), from any two pigs co-housed in the same room (household pairs/room pairs), and from any different pigs (random pairs).
